Tips and Info
     
I supplied the gradient background image (png) from the header, so you can render your logo over it. Everything else is basically text based, so you can edit it from the XHTML file.       
The main thing you need to keep in mind when you upload the files to your server is to keep everything in the same folder. You should have a main directory usually "public" with all the html pages, the css file, and a folder containing the images (structured just as it is in the folder you downloaded).    

I would certainly like to be able to help with all problems that may arise with configuring your template, but simply due to time constraints I can not make any promises. Try to resolve issues through other means and contact me as a last resort.

Good luck with your website!
